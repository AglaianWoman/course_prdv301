*You have learned a lot in the previous nine units.  While you have

 *This unit will cover the practicalities of getting work as a
paralegal.  You will learn about various licensing and certification
requirements to work as a paralegal.  You will also learn what the
outlook is for employment as a paralegal.  Lastly, you will go through

to fully engage in the job search once you have completed the required
studies and other requirements to become a paralegal.*
