**Unit 8: Investigations and Interviews** <span id="8"></span> 
*A client comes to a lawyer after a car accident.  The client has been
injured and believes the other driver caused the accident, but the other
driver’s insurance company is refusing to pay.  The client says the
police were called and that there were several witnesses to the accident
that have been identified.  To determine the client’s legal rights in
the matter, an investigation has to be undertaken.  Here, paralegals
play a key role in investigating a case.*  
  
 *In this unit, you will learn about the methods paralegals use to
investigate a case.  As part of this, you will learn about the drafting
of subpoenas to require the provision of evidence.  You will also learn
how a client intake interview should proceed and how this is different
from interviews of witnesses.  The ability to pull this information
together in a usable format can have a major impact on the success of a
client’s case.  This unit will introduce you to the skills necessary to
do this.*

-   **Reading: NetPlaces: Steve W. Schneider’s “Defining the Goals of
    the Investigation,” “Types of Investigation,” “Investigation
    Resources,” “Important Investigative Qualities,” and “Communicating
    Your Results”**

    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the links above and read these
    articles in their entirety.  The first reading, “Defining the Goals
    of the Investigation,” describes how a paralegal should start an
    investigation.  Investigation does not start with contacting witness
    and collecting evidence.  It must be systematic.  You will find
    information on defining the goals of the investigation and
    developing an investigation plan.  Do not forget to consult the text
    boxes entitled “Essential” and “Fact.”  
      
     The second reading, “Types of Investigation,” provides information
    on various approaches to conducting an investigation.  While one way
    to investigate is to show up at the scene of the activity giving
    rise to civil or criminal liability, there are other approaches that
    may be more effective in certain circumstances.  Investigations may
    be conducted in writing, by telephone, or with a computer.  Be sure
    to take note of the text box entitled “Alert.”  
      
     The third reading, “Investigation Resources,” provides information
    on the many resources available to a paralegal conducting an
    investigation.  Note the importance of developing and maintaining
    your own list of resources.  The “Fact” text box suggests some
    common sources of investigative information.  
      
     While the process of investigation is important, certain attitudes
    and approaches to the process are also critically important.  For
    example, you might not think of a paralegal career as providing much
    of an opportunity for creativity, but as the fourth article,
    “Important Investigative Qualities,” points out, this is a critical
    requirement for good investigations.  
      
     Having gathered your information does not end the investigative
    process.  You have to communicate the information to your
    supervising attorney and others.  The result of your investigation
    will be an investigative report.  In the last article,
    “Communicating Your Results,” pay particular attention to the
    questions you must answer.  
      
     Reading these articles should take approximately 1 hour and 30
    minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this entire
    article.  This article deals with the most fundamental contact with
    a client: the initial telephone call or inquiry.  Here, an
    experienced trial attorney discusses the process a paralegal should
    go through in dealing with that initial contact.  While the
    discussion centers on a personal injury practice, the advice is
    transferable to other areas of the law.  
      
     Reading this article should take approximately 15 minutes.

     Instructions: Please click on the link above and read this entire
    article.  This article deals with interviewing the client during the
    first meeting.  In general, these interviews are conducted by the
    supervising attorney.  However, they are still important to the
    paralegal and will help guide the paralegal’s actions in relation to
    the case.

**8.2.2 Witness Interviews** <span id="8.2.2"></span> 
-   **Reading: NetPlaces: Steve W. Schneider’s “The Fact-Gathering
    Interview,” “Defining the Goals of the Interview,” “Preparing for
    the Interview,” “Interviewing Experts,” and “Communicating Your
    Results”**
    Link: NetPlaces: Steve W. Schneider’s [“The Fact-Gathering
    Interview”](http://www.netplaces.com/paralegal/interviewing/the-fact-gathering-interview.htm)
    (HTML), [“Defining the Goals of the

    (HTML), and [“Communicating Your
    Results”](http://www.netplaces.com/paralegal/interviewing/communicating-your-results-2.htm)
    (HTML)  
      
     Instructions: Please click on the links above and read these
    articles in their entirety.  The first reading, “The Fact-Gathering
    Interview,” describes what is involved when interviewing lay or
    expert witnesses.  You will notice that the two types of questions
    used in witness interviews, open-ended and closed-ended, interact
    with each other.  Thus, an open-ended question may allow an
    opportunity to develop more focused closed-ended question.  In the
    end, the goal is to get relevant and specific facts and to apply
    them to the legal issues in the case.  In addition, you may be
    called on to assess a witness’s credibility and knowledge of the
    important facts.  
      
     The second reading, “Defining the Goals of the Interview,” provides
    information on taking a systematic approach to witness interviews. 
    Often, the nature of an interview is dictated by the goals of the
    supervising attorney.  As noted, checklists help to organize
    information.  However, each interview is different and the effective
    interviewer is not bound by the order of the checklist.  
      
     The third reading, “Preparing for the Interview,” provides
    information on the preparation required for an effective interview. 
    In the law, preparation often accounts for the difference between
    effective and ineffective legal representation.  The paralegal’s
    preparation can range from finding and setting up an interview
    location to deciding the approach the questioning should take.  In
    all situations, the paralegal needs to be very familiar with the
    case.  
      
     The fourth article, “Interviewing Experts,” points out the
    distinctions between the lay witness interview and the expert
    witness interview.  Paralegals often play a large role in finding
    and hiring expert witnesses to provide specific expertise on certain
    matters.  In addition, the paralegal may have an ongoing
    relationship with the expert, and through ongoing interviews, the
    paralegal will explore with the expert how the facts apply to the
    area of expertise.  
      
     Once again, having conducted an interview of a lay or expert
    witness does not conclude the process.  You have to communicate the
    information to your supervising attorney and others.  The result of
    your interview will be an interview memorandum.  The last article,
    “Communicating Your Results,” will provide a three-part approach to
    writing the memorandum that will effectively present the results of
    your interview.  
      
     Reading these articles should take approximately 1 hour.
